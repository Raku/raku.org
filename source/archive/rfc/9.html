<a name='ABSTRACT'></a><h1>ABSTRACT</h1>
<p>Perl5 supports three distinct variable types for any given variable
name corresponding to a scalar (<code>$var</code>), array (<code>@var</code>) and hash
(<code>%var</code>).  This RFC proposes that only one type of variable should be
defined for any given name.  Where an array or hash is defined
(<code>@var</code> or <code>%var</code>), the equivalent scalar value (<code>$var</code>) would be
an implicit reference to that array or hash array.  This would permit
the rationalisation and simplification of the syntax required to
access individual elements or slices of arrays and hash arrays, while
remaining backwardly compatible with Perl5 syntax.  The only
semantic difference would be that scripts could no longer rely on
<code>$var</code>, <code>%var</code> and <code>@var</code> referencing different variables.</p>
<a name='DESCRIPTION'></a><h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>Perl5 supports three distinct variable types for any given variable
name corresponding to a scalar (<code>$foo</code>), array (<code>@foo</code>) and hash
(<code>%foo</code>).  Each of these may be defined and exists independantly of
the others (NOTE: sub-routines, formats and I/O handles are outside
the scope of this document).</p>
<pre>    $foo =   'Hello World';
    @foo = ( 'Hello', 'World' );
    %foo = ( 'Hello' =&gt; 'World' );</pre>
<p>When accessing variables, and in particular, elements or slices of
lists or hash arrays, the <i>funny character</i> prefix is used to denote
the multiplicity of the returned value(s); <code>$</code> = 'the', <code>@</code> =
'these'.  Although it can be argued that this is logical and
consistent (it is), it can also cause confusion because the prefix is
used to denote what is returned, rather than indicating the variable
from which the value(s) are retrieved.  For example:</p>
<pre>    $foo[2];	           # third element of @foo, no relation to $foo
    @foo{'bar', 'baz'};    # slice of %foo, no relation to @foo</pre>
<p>In effect, it is the brackets <code>[]</code> that associate the variable name
with the list type <code>@foo</code> and the braces <code>{}</code> that imply the hash
type <code>%foo</code>.</p>
<p>This RFC proposes that only one type of variable should be defined for
any given name.  Where an array or hash is defined, the scalar value
of the same name would implicitly contain a reference to that array
or hash.  Thus there can be no confusion as to which of the variables
is being accessed because &quot;there can be only one&quot;.</p>
<pre>    @bar = ( 3, 5, 7 );    # $bar is implicitly \@bar
    $bar = [ 3, 5, 7 ];    # same as above
    $bar[2];               # third element of @bar, value 7               
    $bar-&gt;[2];		   # same as above

    %baz = ( a =&gt; 11 );	   # $baz is implicitly \%baz
    $baz = { a =&gt; 11 };    # identical to above
    $baz{ a };		   # 'a' entry of %baz, value 11
    $baz-&gt;{ a };	   # same as above</pre>
<p>The '-&gt;' would become redundant (but optional for backwards
compatability), with an implicit dereference associated with every
pair of braces or brackets.  In Perl 5, there is an implied '-&gt;'
between every pair of adjacent braces or brackets but not the first,
e.g.</p>
<pre>    $wiz-&gt;[$x][$y][$z]    ===   $wiz-&gt;[$x]-&gt;[$y]-&gt;[$z]
    $waz-&gt;{$x}{$y}{$z}    ===   $waz-&gt;{$x}-&gt;{$y}-&gt;{$z}</pre>
<p>Under this proposal, the rule would apply to <i>all</i> cases and the
above examples could be written as:</p>
<pre>    $wiz[$x][$y][$z]
    $waz{$x}{$y}{$z}</pre>
<p>Array slices could be specified as either of the following:</p>
<pre>    $bar[0..2];
    @bar[0..2];</pre>
<p>Similarly for hash slices:</p>
<pre>    $baz{'a'..'c'};
    %baz{'a'..'c'};        # for consistency (not sure about this)
    @baz{'a'..'c'};        # for backwards compatability</pre>
<p>In effect, all arrays and hashes are stored in <code>$var</code> as references to
the same, with <code>@bar</code> and <code>%baz</code> being synonymous for the existing
<code>@$bar</code> and <code>%$baz</code> constructs.</p>
<a name='IMPLEMENTATION'></a><h1>IMPLEMENTATION</h1>
<p>Everything depends on how the internals are reworked.</p>
<a name='ISSUES'></a><h1>ISSUES</h1>
<p>Sub-routines would not be affected by these changes, continuing to be
referenced as <code>&amp;foo()</code> or <code>foo()</code>.</p>
<p>Existing scripts can be automatically converted to preserve multiple
variable semantics, e.g.</p>
<pre>    $foo -&gt; $foo
    %foo -&gt; $foo__hash
    @foo -&gt; $foo__list</pre>
<p>Internal multi-type variables would need renaming, e.g. @INC/%INC</p>
<p>This RFC could do with a better title.</p>
