<a name='ABSTRACT'></a><h1>ABSTRACT</h1>
<p>This RFC proposes that the second argument to <code>bless</code> be made
mandatory, and that its semantics be enhanced slightly to cover a
common, ugly, and frequently buggy usage.</p>
<a name='DESCRIPTION'></a><h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<a name='Mandatory second argument'></a><h2>Mandatory second argument</h2>
<p>When omitted, the second argument to <code>bless</code> currently defaults to the
name of the package from which the call to <code>bless</code> is being made. This
default behaviour leads to unexpected and undesirable behaviour whenever
a constructor is inherited by a derived class:</p>
<pre>        package Base;
        
        sub new { bless {} }
        
        
        package Derived;
        use base 'Base';
        
        
        package main;
        
        $obj = Derived-&gt;new();          # Creates an object blessed into Base!
        </pre>
<p>To remove this nasty surprise is proposed that the second argument to
<code>bless</code> be made mandatory.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if the second argument is to remain optional, the default
value should be the invocant: normally $_[0], but possibly whatever
access mechanism has been specified under <code>use invocant</code>.</p>
<a name='Extended second argument semantics'></a><h2>Extended second argument semantics</h2>
<p>A common idiom in OO Perl is to allow constructors to be called
as both class- and object- methods by writing:</p>
<pre>        sub new {
                bless {}, ref($_[0]) || $_[0];
        }
        </pre>
<p>It is proposed that the above clutter be rendered unnecessary.
Specifically, if the second argument to <code>bless</code> is a reference,
that it be stringified by calling <code>ref</code>, rather than by the usual
stringification process.</p>
<p>This would allow the above example to be written as:</p>
<pre>        sub new {
                bless {}, $_[0];
        }
        </pre>
<p>More importantly, it would allow calls to <code>bless</code> which <i>don't</i>
use the <code>ref($_[0])||$_[0]</code> idiom to Do The Right Thing,
instead of the existing bizarre behaviour (i.e. blessing
into classes with names like <code>'MyClass=HASH(0x5a7f590)'</code> [sic].</p>
<a name='Alternative (restricted) second argument semantics'></a><h2>Alternative (restricted) second argument semantics</h2>
<p>An alternative to extending the semantics of the second argument, would
be to cause <code>bless</code> to issue a warning or exception when called with a
reference as its second argument. This would still require an explicit
<code>ref($_[0])||$_[0]</code> where such behaviour was desired, but would catch
erroneous uses.</p>
<p>And anyone truly desiring the bizarre existing behaviour could
simply use:</p>
<pre>        sub new {
                bless {}, &quot;$_[0]&quot;;
        }
        </pre>
<a name='MIGRATION ISSUES'></a><h1>MIGRATION ISSUES</h1>
<p>Minimal, since only the truly wicked ever invoke <code>bless</code> with only
one argument.</p>
<p>Migration would consist of translating instances of:</p>
<pre>        bless REF;
        </pre>
<p>to:</p>
<pre>        bless REF, __PACKAGE__;         # Note: this may break inheritance!
        
        </pre>
<p>Changes to second argument semantics would have no impact except in
pathological cases. In practice, the new semantics would silently fix a
large number of lurking bugs in existing code.</p>
