<p>the suggested coercion system is admitedly ad hoc.</p>
<a name='ABSTRACT'></a><h1>ABSTRACT</h1>
<p>Another to overload a named function is
by return type.  This document is a companion piece to
a similarly named one about protoypes.</p>
<a name='DESCRIPTION'></a><h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>Defining multiple subroutines with both the same name and the same calling
interface that explicitly return items of differing types is now
allowed.</p>
<a name='methods are subroutines'></a><h2>methods are subroutines</h2>
<p>I use the words &quot;method&quot; and &quot;subroutine&quot; interchangably in this document.
I do this because I find &quot;subroutine&quot; to invoke an aura of drawing flow charts and explicit program counter incrementation.  &quot;subroutine&quot; means, &quot;a routine
which is part of a larger routine&quot; and focuses on the implementation. &quot;Method&quot;
on the other hand means &quot;a way of doing&quot; and is a word more at home with
the OO abstractions which this RFC promotes.</p>
<a name='what constitutes a context?'></a><h2>what constitutes a context?</h2>
<p>We are familiar with &quot;scalar context&quot; and &quot;array context&quot; from perl5 and
previous.  Perl6 gives us user-defined contexts as well as user defined
types or all sorts.  Any unique string or &quot;compiled interface object,&quot;
should such exist,  can be a context, for the purposes
of context-based method overloading.</p>
<a name='interaction with prototype-based and traditional overloading'></a><h2>interaction with prototype-based and traditional overloading</h2>
<p>A traditional perlsub may be considered the simultaneous
definition of two routines
<code>$ sub(PROTO){body}</code> and
<code>@ sub(PROTO){body}</code>.</p>
<p>It is now possible to differentiate between these two explicitly, as
well as accessing the (now extended?) <code>want</code> methods within a generic method.</p>
<a name='guaranteed sane values'></a><h2>guaranteed sane values</h2>
<p>The return context is considered before considering the types of the
arguments, and in the case of no exact match, the fallback is to a
default method defined to work in the given context rather than to
the default method for the name, should one exist.</p>
<p>This provides a guarantee to a typed variable that it will not be
loaded with a value that does not make sense to it.  Untyped variables
are not affected.</p>
<a name='implicit contexts'></a><h2>implicit contexts</h2>
<p>Assignment where the Lvalue is typed implies a context, which
may change dynamicly as typed objects move around as scalars.</p>
<a name='acceptable coercions'></a><h2>acceptable coercions</h2>
<p>When resolving which method <code>foo()</code> to call in a context CTXT, and there
is no method  <code>foo()</code> defined for the context CTXT, Perl will examine
the types listed in <code>@CTXT::ISA{OVERLOAD_CONTEXTS}</code> for a list
of other contexts
to see if <code>foo()</code> can produce, before throwing an error.  This search
is NOT recursive, unless defined so by the tying of the array to a
dynamic iterator.</p>
<a name='ambiguity resolution'></a><h2>ambiguity resolution</h2>
<p>In situations where multiple interpretations are possible, such
as the f(g()) situation, the first possible method that will work
is called.</p>
<p>The search order is based on the preferences of the outer function,
then the preferences of the inner function.</p>
<p>Functions maintain their preference order in an array</p>
<pre>	@PACKNAME::methodname{OVERLOAD_PREFERENCES}</pre>
<p>and the first context specifier found in that array, which can be
satisifed with a call to the named method, is used.</p>
<p>If no such array exists,</p>
<pre>	@PACKNAME::OVERLOAD_PREFERENCES </pre>
<p>is consulted.</p>
<p>Perl6 maintains a global @CORE::OVERLOAD_PREFERENCES which begins
with <code>qw(ARRAY SCALAR)</code> and has all types declared in the program
appended to it as they appear, which is used when neither a method
nor its class does not
provide its own OVERLOAD_PREFERENCES array.</p>
<a name='specification incomplete'></a><h2>specification incomplete</h2>
<p>Further points to discuss and agree on include the relation of this
mechanism to inheritance, and multiple inheritance, and the meta-alteration
of all aspects of the mechanism.</p>
<a name='IMPLEMENTATION'></a><h1>IMPLEMENTATION</h1>
<p>At compile time, the keys in the big hash (be it global or per-package
or per-class) that holds the mapping from the names of the classes
to their coderefs are further extended to include,
as well as the prototype,
the declared type of the return values, when specified,
as part of the
name of each method.</p>
<p>Method names store their own rules, if any, for resolving which
method of the set with that name are to be called in a dispatch
situation, in a specially prototyped method.</p>
