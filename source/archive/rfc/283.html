<a name='ABSTRACT'></a><h1>ABSTRACT</h1>
<p><code>tr///</code> in array context should return a histogram explaining the
number of matches for each letter in the pattern.</p>
<a name='DESCRIPTION'></a><h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>This has been on the Perl 5 to-do list for ages and ages. The idea is
that when you're transliterating a bunch of things, you want to know
how many of each of them matched in your original string.</p>
<p>For instance, while <code>tr/x//</code> will count the x's, <code>tr/xy//</code> will count
both x's and y's - you don't know how many of each. So, the proposal is
that <code>tr</code> in the array context should return a hash, like this:</p>
<pre>    (%foo) = &quot;xyzzy&quot; =~ tr/xyz//

    # %foo is ( x =&gt; 1, y =&gt; 2, z =&gt; 3);</pre>
<a name='IMPLEMENTATION'></a><h1>IMPLEMENTATION</h1>
<p>I posted a patch to Perl 5.6 to do this some time back; it's a very
simple matter of constructing the hash and incrementing the values every
time you do a transliteration of a character. Of course, since we don't
know what Perl 6's transliteration operator's going to look like, it's
hard to know how to implement an extension to it...</p>
