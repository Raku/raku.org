<a name='ABSTRACT'></a><h1>ABSTRACT</h1>
<p>This RFC fleshes out variable declarations with <code>my</code>, and also proposes
a way to assign attributes without the need for a <code>my</code> anywhere. Much
of this stuff has been hinted at, so this is just a formalization.</p>
<p>Please note this entire document is <b>optional</b>, intended for those that
need this type of control. Perl is not a B&amp;D language (by default, at
least :).</p>
<a name='DESCRIPTION'></a><h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>Camel-3 shows some interesting hints of what's been proposed for <code>my</code>
declarations:</p>
<pre>   my type $var :attr1 :attr2 = $value;</pre>
<p>And we all know that you can use <code>my</code> to declare a group of variables:</p>
<pre>   my($x, $y, $z);</pre>
<p>Here's the issues:</p>
<pre>   1. How do the two jive together?
  
   2. Should it be possible to assign attributes to individual elements
      of hashes/arrays? (yes)</pre>
<a name='Cohesive my syntax'></a><h2>Cohesive <code>my</code> syntax</h2>
<p>This RFC proposes that you be able to group multiple variables of the
same type within parens:</p>
<pre>   my int ($x, $y, $z);
   my int ($x :64bit, $y :32bit, $z);</pre>
<p>It seems most logical that:</p>
<pre>   1. The type will be the same across variables; this is common
      usage in other languages because it makes sense.

   2. The attributes will be different for different variables.</pre>
<p>As such, multiple attributes can be assigned and grouped flexibly:</p>
<pre>   my int ($x, $y, $z) :64bit;           # all are 64-bit
   my int ($x, $y, $z :unsigned) :64bit; # plus $z is unsigned</pre>
<p>Note that multiple types cannot be specified on the same line. To
declare variables of multiple types, you must use separate statements:</p>
<pre>   my int ($x, $y, $z) :64bit;
   my string ($firstname, $lastname :long);</pre>
<p>This is consistent with other languages and also makes parsing
realistic.</p>
<a name='Assigning attributes to individual elements of hashes/arrays'></a><h2>Assigning attributes to individual elements of hashes/arrays</h2>
<p>This is potentially very useful. &quot;:laccess&quot;, &quot;:raccess&quot;, &quot;:public&quot;,
&quot;:private&quot;, and others spring to mind as potential candidates for this.
This RFC proposes that in addition to attributes being assigned to a
whole entity on declaration:</p>
<pre>   my int @a :64bit;       # makes each element a 64-bit int
   my string %h :long;     # each key/val is long string</pre>
<p>They can also be declared on individual elements, without the need for
<code>my</code> or <code>our</code>:</p>
<pre>   $a[0] :32bit = get_val;           # 32-bit
   $r-&gt;{name} :private = &quot;Nate&quot;;     # privatize single value
   $s-&gt;{VAL} :laccess('data') = &quot;&quot;;  # lvalue autoaccessor</pre>
<p>Assigning attributes to individual elements has the advantage over
keywords of allowing them to be grouped:</p>
<pre>   $self-&gt;{name} :public :roaccess('getname') = &quot;Nathan Wiger&quot;;</pre>
<p>However, a problem arises in how to assign types to singular elements,
since this requires a <code>my</code>:</p>
<pre>   my int $a[0] :64bit;     # just makes that single element
                            # a lexically-scoped 64-bit int?

   my string $h{name} = &quot;&quot;; # cast $h{name} to string, rescope %h?</pre>
<p>Currently, lexical scope has no meaning for individual elements of
hashes and arrays. However, assigning attributes and even types to
individual elements seems useful. There's two ways around this that I
see:</p>
<pre>   1. On my'ing of an individual hash/array element, the
      entire hash/array is rescoped to the nearest block.

   2. Only the individual element is rescoped, similar
      to what happens when you do this:

          my $x = 5;
          {
             my $x = 10;
          }</pre>
<p>Either of these solutions is acceptable, and they both have their pluses
and minuses. The second one seems more consistent, but is potentially
extremely difficult to implement.</p>

<p>None. This introduces a more flexible syntax but does not break old
ones.</p>
