<a name='ABSTRACT'></a><h1>ABSTRACT</h1>
<p>Future perl version numbers will converge on 2 * PI</p>
<a name='DESCRIPTION'></a><h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>By the end of this committee meeting, we will have a language
that is arbitrarily extensible in accordance with decades of
computer programming practice.</p>
<p>Perl6 is NOT a quick hack done to save implementor time.  It is a
carefully crafted piece of fine work.  It is correct.</p>
<p>Having put all this work into it, we would like to see this
version stick around a while, in the way of Knuth's TeX language
or [pick your favorite historical math figure]'s [particular
lasting contribution.]</p>
<a name='IMPLEMENTATION'></a><h1>IMPLEMENTATION</h1>
<p>Since versioning is a meta-implementation issue, all that
is required is that
we all agree that stealing TeX's versioning system is a good idea.</p>
<p>The first release will be 6, and then each subsequent
release may or may not extend a digit.</p>
