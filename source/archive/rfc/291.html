<a name='ABSTRACT'></a><h1>ABSTRACT</h1>
<p>In Perl6 it should be easy to see to check whether any particular
module comes from the Perl core or not.</p>
<a name='DESCRIPTION'></a><h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>Randy J. Ray or Tim Bunce mentions the following in the Devel::Modlist
documentation:</p>
<p>&quot;Suppress the display of those modules that are a part of the Perl core. This
is dependent on the Perl private library area not being an exact substring of
the site-dependent library. The build process checks this for you prior to
install.&quot;</p>
<p>I'd suggest that just like the version of a module being useful, and
hence available as, say $Devel::Modlist::VERSION, the fact that a
module is currently in the Perl core is an important fact to know and
should be available as, perhaps: $Devel::Modlist::CORE.</p>
<p>The actual name chosen, or even the way this is done, is open to discussion.</p>
<p>This feature will be useful for quite a number of uses, including
doing lots of meta-module stuff like Devel::Modlist.</p>
<a name='IMPLEMENTATION'></a><h1>IMPLEMENTATION</h1>
<p>If followed as above, we would simply have the package variable $CORE
set to be true in all modules in the Perl standard library.</p>
<p>Converting perl5 to perl6 would have to make sure that any $CORE
variables need to be translated to another name.</p>
