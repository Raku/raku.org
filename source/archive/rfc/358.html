<a name='ABSTRACT'></a><h1>ABSTRACT</h1>
<p>To simplify distribution of programs in binary form,
support for dump should be kept.</p>
<a name='DESCRIPTION'></a><h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>This would immensely aid distribution of code from one Linux, Windows,
etc. machine to others without requiring all the recipients to be able
to install Perl, compile and install modules required by the program,
and configure their hosts so that Perl find the modules.  There are
also times when pre-loading and pre-processing large amounts of data
are desirable.</p>
<a name='IMPLEMENTATION'></a><h1>IMPLEMENTATION</h1>
<p>RFC 267 wants dump eliminated mainly because it is a common name for
user subroutines, bit also because it can be accomplished with a kill
signal. I really do not care if dump is renamed, but I believe keeping
the capability is in perl's interest for greater acceptance and use.</p>
