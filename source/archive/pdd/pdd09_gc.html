<p>docs/pdds/pdd09_gc.pod - Garbage Collection Subsystems</p>
<a name='ABSTRACT'></a><h1>ABSTRACT</h1>
<p>This PDD describes how DOD/GC systems work, and what's required of PMC
classes.</p>
<a name='DESCRIPTION'></a><h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>Doing DOD takes a bit of work--we need to make sure that everything is
findable from the root set, and that we don't go messing up data
shared between interpreters.</p>
<a name='GC TERMS'></a><h1>GC TERMS</h1>
<a name='GC Schemes'></a><h2>GC Schemes</h2>
<p>There are basically three general schemes to achieve garbage
collection.</p>
<ul>
<li><a name='Reference counting'></a>Reference counting</li>
<p>All objects have a count, how often they are refered to by other
objects. If that count reaches zero, the object's space can be
reclaimed. This scheme can't cope with reference loops, i.e, a loop
of dead objects, all referencing one another but not reachable from
elsewhere, never gets collected.</p>
<li><a name='Mark and Sweep'></a>Mark and Sweep</li>
<p>Starting from the root set (Parrot registers, stacks, internal
structures) all reachable objects (and objects reachable from these)
are marked being alive.</p>
<p>Ojbects not reached are considered being dead and get collected by a
sweep through the objects arenas.</p>
<li><a name='Copying collection'></a>Copying collection</li>
<p>Live objects are copied into a new memory region. The old memory space
can then be reclaimed.</p>
</ul>
<a name='GC Variants'></a><h2>GC Variants</h2>
<ul>
<li><a name='stop-the-world'></a>stop-the-world</li>
<p>During a GC cycle the processing of user code is stopped. Normal
operation continues only after the whole GC cycle is performed. This
can lead to arbitrary long pauses during program execution.</p>
<li><a name='incremental'></a>incremental</li>
<p>GC is done in small increments intermittent with normal program
operation.</p>
<li><a name='real-time'></a>real-time</li>
<p>The pauses caused by GC don't exceed a certain limit.</p>
<li><a name='concurrent'></a>concurrent</li>
<p>The GC system runs as a separate thread and really concurrently on a
multi-processor machine.</p>
<li><a name='parallel'></a>parallel</li>
<p>Multiple threads are participating in GC.</p>
<li><a name='generational'></a>generational</li>
<p>The object space is divided between a young generation (short-lived
temporaries) and one or more old generations. By not scanning the old
generation this can considerably speed up GC.</p>
</ul>
<a name='GC SUBSYSTEMS'></a><h1>GC SUBSYSTEMS</h1>
<a name='Fix-sized Headers'></a><h2>Fix-sized Headers</h2>
<p>All managed objects (PMCs, Strings, Buffers) inside Parrot are subject
to garbage collection. As these objects aren't allowed to move after
creation, garbage collection is done by a non-copying scheme. Further:
as we have to cope with pointers to objects on the C stack and in CPU
registers, the garbage collection scheme is a conservative one.</p>
<p>DOD/GC is normally triggered by allocation of new objects, which happens
usually from some stack nesting below the run-loop. There is a small
chance that an integer on the C stack is misinterpreted as a pointer
to an object. This object would kept alive in such a case.</p>
<p>The live-ness information gained by dead object detection (DOD) is also the
base for collecting variable sized-data that may hang off buffers.</p>
<a name='Variable-sized Buffer Memory'></a><h2>Variable-sized Buffer Memory</h2>
<p>Variable-sized memory like string memory gets collected, when the
associated header isn't found to be alive during DOD. While a copying
collection could basically[1] be done at any time, its inefficient to
copy buffers of objects that are non yet detected being dead. This
implies that before a collection in the memory pools is run, a DOD run
for fixed-sized headers is triggered.</p>
<p>[1] Dead objects stay dead, there is no possibility of a reusal of
dead objects.</p>
<a name='IMPLEMENTATION OF FIXED-SIZED HEADER GC'></a><h1>IMPLEMENTATION OF FIXED-SIZED HEADER GC</h1>
<a name='General Notes'></a><h2>General Notes</h2>
<p>GC subsystems are rather independent. The goal for Parrot is just to
provide new object headers in the fasted possible way. How that is
achieved can be considered as an implementation detail.</p>
<p>While GC subsystems are independent they may share some code to reduce
Parrot memory footprint. E.g. stop-the-world mark and sweep and
incremental mark and sweep use the same arena structures and share
arena creation and DOD routines.</p>
<a name='Initialization'></a><h2>Initialization</h2>
<p>Currently only one GC system is active (selected at configure or
compile time). But future versions might support switching GC systems
during runtime to accomodate for different work loads.</p>
<ul>
<li><a name='void Parrot_gc_XXX_init(Interp *)'></a><code>void Parrot_gc_XXX_init(Interp *)</code></li>
<p>Initialize GC system named <code>XXX</code>.</p>
<p>Called from <b><i>src/memory.c:mem_setup_allocator()</i></b> after creating
<code>arena_base</code>. The initialization code is responsible for the creation
of the header pools and has to fill the following function pointer
slots in <code>arena_base</code>:</p>
</ul>
<a name='Arena_base function pointers'></a><h2>Arena_base function pointers</h2>
<ul>
<li><a name='void (*do_dod_run) (Interp *, int flags)'></a><code>void (*do_dod_run) (Interp *, int flags)</code></li>
<p>Trigger or perform a DOD/GC run.</p>
<p>Flags is one of:</p>
<ul>
<li><a name='DOD_trace_normal | DOD_trace_stack_FLAG'></a>DOD_trace_normal | DOD_trace_stack_FLAG</li>
<p>Run a normal GC cycle. This is normally called by resource shortage in
the buffer memory pools before a collection is run. The bit named
<code>DOD_trace_stack_FLAG</code> indicates that the C-stack (and other system
areas like the processor registers) have to be traced too.</p>
<p>The implementation might or might not actually run a full GC cycle. If
e.g an incremental GC system just has finished the mark phase, it
would do nothing. OTOH if no objects are currently marked live, the
implementation should run the mark phase, so that copying of dead
objects is avoided.</p>
<li><a name='DOD_lazy_FLAG'></a>DOD_lazy_FLAG</li>
<p>Do a timely destruction run. The goal is to either detect all objects
that need timely destruction or to do a full collection. In the former
case the collection can be interrupted or postponed. This is called
from the Parrot run-loop. No system areas have to be traced.</p>
<li><a name='DOD_finish_FLAG'></a>DOD_finish_FLAG</li>
<p>Called during interpreter destruction. The GC subsystem must clear the
live state of all objects and perform a sweep in the PMC header pool,
so that destructors and finalizers get called.</p>
<li><a name='DOD_no_trace_volatile_roots'></a>DOD_no_trace_volatile_roots</li>
<p>Trace root set except volatile roots. That is skip e.g. registers.</p>
</ul>
<li><a name='void (*de_init_gc_system) (Interp*)'></a><code>void (*de_init_gc_system) (Interp*)</code></li>
<p>Called during interpreter destruction. Free used resources and memory
pools.</p>
<li><a name='void (*mark_object) (Interp*, Pobj*)'></a><code>void (*mark_object) (Interp*, Pobj*)</code></li>
<p>Mark the object being live. This function gets invoked by the
following macro:</p>
<li><a name='Parrot_pobj_lives(Interp*, PObj *)'></a><code>Parrot_pobj_lives(Interp*, PObj *)</code></li>
<p>which might do nothing if the object is already marked live.</p>
</ul>
<a name='Object allocation'></a><h2>Object allocation</h2>
<p>Each header pool provides one function pointer to get a new object
from that pool.</p>
<ul>
<li><a name='PObj * (*get_free_object) (Interp*, struct Small_Object_Pool*)'></a><code>PObj * (*get_free_object) (Interp*, struct Small_Object_Pool*)</code></li>
<p>It should return one free object from the given pool. Object flags are
returned clear, except flags that are used by the garbage collector
itself. If the pool is a buffer header pool, all other object memory
is zeroed.</p>
</ul>
<a name='Write Barrier'></a><h2>Write Barrier</h2>
<p>The GC subsystem has to provide these (possibly empty) macros:</p>
<ul>
<li><a name='DOD_WRITE_BARRIER(Interp*, PMC *agg, PMC *old, PMC *new)'></a><code>DOD_WRITE_BARRIER(Interp*, PMC *agg, PMC *old, PMC *new)</code></li>
<p>This macro is invoked when in aggregate <code>agg</code> the element <code>old</code> is
getting overritten by <code>new</code>. Both <code>old</code> and <code>new</code> may be NULL.</p>
<li><a name='DOD_WRITE_BARRIER_KEY(Interp*, PMC *agg, PMC *old, PObj *old_key, PMC *new, PObj *new_key)'></a><code>DOD_WRITE_BARRIER_KEY(Interp*, PMC *agg, PMC *old, PObj *old_key, PMC *new, PObj *new_key)</code></li>
<p>Like above. Invoked when a hash key is inserted, possibly replacing
and old key.</p>
</ul>
<a name='The Arena_base structure'></a><h2>The Arena_base structure</h2>
<p>The <code>arena_base</code> holds the mentioned function pointers, pointers to
the header pools, some statistic counters, and a pointer <code>void *gc_private</code>
reserved for the GC subsystem.</p>
<p>The GC subsystem is responsible for updating the appropriate statistic
fields of the structure.</p>
<a name='Blocking GC'></a><h2>Blocking GC</h2>
<p>Being able to block GC and DOD is important--you'd hate to have the
newly allocated Buffers or PMCs you've got yanked out from underneath
you. That'd be no fun. Use the following routines to control GC:</p>
<ul>
<li><a name='Parrot_block_DOD(Interp *interpreter)'></a>Parrot_block_DOD(Interp *interpreter)</li>
<p>Block DOD for the passed interpreter. (But <b>not</b> GC)</p>
<li><a name='Parrot_block_GC(Interp *interpreter)'></a>Parrot_block_GC(Interp *interpreter)</li>
<p>Block GC for the passed interpreter. (But <b>not</b> DOD)</p>
<li><a name='Parrot_unblock_DOD(Interp *interpreter)'></a>Parrot_unblock_DOD(Interp *interpreter)</li>
<p>Unblock DOD for the passed interpreter. (But not GC)</p>
<li><a name='Parrot_unblock_GC(Interp *interpreter)'></a>Parrot_unblock_GC(Interp *interpreter)</li>
<p>Unblock GC for the passed interpreter. (But not DOD)</p>
</ul>
<p>Note that the blocking is recursive--if you call Parrot_block_DOD()
three times in succession, you need to call Parrot_unblock_DOD() three
times to re-enable DOD.</p>
<a name='Important flags'></a><h2>Important flags</h2>
<p>For PMCs and Buffers to be collected properly, you <b>must</b> get the
flags set on them properly. Otherwise Bad Things Will Happen.</p>
<p>Note: don't manipulate these flags directly. Always use the macros
defined in <b><i>include/parrot/pobj.h</i></b>.</p>
<ul>
<li><a name='PObj_active_destroy_FLAG'></a>PObj_active_destroy_FLAG</li>
<p>The PMC has some sort of active destructor, and will have that
destructor called when the PMC is destroyed.</p>
<li><a name='PObj_custom_mark_FLAG'></a>PObj_custom_mark_FLAG</li>
<p>The <code>mark</code> vtable slot will be called during DOD. The mark function
must call <code>Parrot_pobj_lives</code> for all non-NULL objects that PMC
refers too.</p>
<p>Please note that <code>Parrot_pobj_lives</code> may be a macro.</p>
<li><a name='PObj_data_is_PMC_array_FLAG'></a>PObj_data_is_PMC_array_FLAG</li>
<p>Set if the data pointer points to an array of objects. The length of
the array is <code>PMC_int_val(SELF)</code>.</p>
<li><a name='PObj_external_FLAG'></a>PObj_external_FLAG</li>
<p>Set if the buffer points to memory that came from outside Parrot's
memory system.</p>
<li><a name='PObj_sysmem_FLAG'></a>PObj_sysmem_FLAG</li>
<p>Set if the memory came from the system malloc. When the buffer is
considered dead, the memory will be freed back to the system.</p>
<li><a name='PObj_COW_FLAG'></a>PObj_COW_FLAG</li>
<p>The buffer's memory is copy on write. Any changes to the buffer must
first have the buffer's memory copied. The COW flag should then be
removed.</p>
</ul>
<p>The following flags can be used by the GC subsystem:</p>
<ul>
<li><a name='PObj_live_FLAG'></a>PObj_live_FLAG</li>
<p>The system considers the object to be alive for collection purposes.</p>
<li><a name='PObj_on_free_list_FLAG'></a>PObj_on_free_list_FLAG</li>
<p>The object is unused, and on the free list for later allocation.</p>
<li><a name='PObj_custom_GC_FLAG'></a>PObj_custom_GC_FLAG</li>
<p>DWIM.</p>
