<a name='The Perl 6 summary for the week ending 2006-01-01'></a><h1>The Perl 6 summary for the week ending 2006-01-01</h1>
<p>Another year, another summary. You might think I'm going to summarize
the events of the whole year, but it turns out that chromatic's
already done it. So in the spirit of laziness, I'll just point you at
his year end summary.</p>
<p><a href='http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/8894' target='_blank'>www.oreillynet.com</a></p>
<p>Sadly for us all, he doesn't go into enough detail on the events of
the last week for me to go straight into the coda. I shall have to
talk to him about next year.</p>
<p>This week sees a big non-technical change in the Pugs camp, lots of
roadmapping and implementation in the Parrot camp, and a more and more
concrete feel of what the language is going to look like in the
perl6-language camp.</p>
<p>Pretty much business as usual really.</p>
<a name='This week in perl6-compiler'></a><h1>This week in perl6-compiler</h1>
<a name='Runtime typecasting'></a><h2>Runtime typecasting</h2>
<p>Autrijus Tang is now Audrey Tang. Read her explanation on her
blog. Speaking personally I'm delighted that she's found the courage
to make the change and wish her the best of luck and happiness in her
new/true identity.</p>

<a name='Pugs on Cygwin'></a><h2>Pugs on Cygwin</h2>
<p>There was a fair amount of discussion on getting pugs and parrot
running in the Cygwin environment this week. Last time I looked,
things were working again.</p>

<a name='This week's Pugs developments'></a><h2>This week's Pugs developments</h2>
<p>Audrey's taken to summarizing pugs developments on her blog and to
posting digests of these posts on the list. She wrote about PIL and
Rules this week.</p>

<a name='Meanwhile, in perl6-internals'></a><h1>Meanwhile, in perl6-internals</h1>
<a name='Threading PDD?'></a><h2>Threading PDD?</h2>
<p>Patrick Michaud suggested, after a question from Klaas-Jan Stol, that
it might be a good idea to create a placeholder Threading PDD (Parrot
Design Document) noting that threading hasn't been specced yet and
that a draft would be welcomed. Warnock applies.</p>

<a name='Pugs is the official Perl 6?'></a><h2>Pugs is the official Perl 6?</h2>
<p>Or am I putting words into Luke's mouth? Read, then decide.</p>

<a name='.imc or .pir? There can only be one'></a><h2>.imc or .pir? There can only be one</h2>
<p>As part of the great Parrot reorganization, Chip declared that the IMC
vs PIR ambiguity had to be resolved. As he put it:</p>
<p>IMC vs. PIR</p>
<p>Two names enter</p>
<p>One name leaves</p>
<p>The name that left was PIR, any files you find with .imc extensions
should be cruelly laughed at while you kick sand in their faces.</p>

<a name='Dynamic binding patch'></a><h2>Dynamic binding patch</h2>
<p>Bob Rogers offered up a patch to implement dynamic binding of globals
for the list's consideration. Leo thought the patch was mostly sound,
but that the whole dynamic binding thing needed more thought and
infrastructure. Which is probably a broad hint to Chip and possibly
@Larry (said hint hasn't been taken yet though, well, not in public).</p>
<p><a href='http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=17333.25927.15166.416455@rgrjr.dyndns.org' target='_blank'>groups.google.com</a></p>
<a name='Smoke testing'></a><h2>Smoke testing</h2>
<p>Leo pointed everyone at the Perl Image Testing Architecture, which has
possibly the coolest acronym of any Perl project in recent years. He
thought it would be useful to use for additional Parrot platform
testing as well.</p>

<p><a href='http://ali.as/pita/' target='_blank'>ali.as</a></p>
<a name='Lots and lots of TODOs'></a><h2>Lots and lots of TODOs</h2>
<p>I'm not going to enumerate them here, but Will Coleda, Matt Diephouse
and others have been adding loads of TODO entries to the Parrot
bugtracker. Which is nice.</p>
<a name='IMCC optimizer instruction duplication and opcode write/reads'></a><h2>IMCC optimizer instruction duplication and opcode write/reads</h2>
<p>Amos Robinson wanted to know how to go about duplicating instructions
and wondered about the correct semantics of in/out/inout
arguments. Leo came through with the answers.</p>
<p><a href='http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=cf7d0f370512310643s31ff2cf4n2d952aeb57c31f70@mail.gmail.com' target='_blank'>groups.google.com</a></p>
<a name='Meanwhile in perl6-language'></a><h1>Meanwhile in perl6-language</h1>
<a name='Iterating over complex structures'></a><h2>Iterating over complex structures</h2>
<p>Rob Kinyon applied the 'What does Ruby do?' pattern to the problem of
iterating over complex structures. Mostly it looks good, but I'm
hoping that someone else considers applying the 'What does Smalltalk
do?' pattern as well. Subject to tuit supply, I might even do that
myself.</p>
<p><a href='http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=70384420512251808q3c3bc01cue2cd8af86062d9bb@mail.gmail.com' target='_blank'>groups.google.com</a></p>
<a name='Match objects'></a><h2>Match objects</h2>
<p>&quot;Who is Match, and to what does he object?&quot;</p>
<p>Sorry. Couldn't resist.</p>
<p>Patrick and Luke discussed the behaviour of match objects.</p>
<a name='(Array) introspection'></a><h2>(Array) introspection</h2>
<p>Ilmari Vacklin wondered about how to introspect on the structure of
arrays and other data structures. Warnock applies.</p>
<p><a href='http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=1135632846.7282.4.camel@localhost.localdomain' target='_blank'>groups.google.com</a></p>
<a name='Array/list transformations'></a><h2>Array/list transformations</h2>
<p>Rob Kinyon pointed out the difficulties of dealing with binding array
slices and other such goodies. Larry thought it wasn't really that
difficult (from the point of view of the perl programmer, things might
be different for the implementers)</p>
<p><a href='http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=70384420512262110u4ce4861o628e3a0b585e8bae@mail.gmail.com' target='_blank'>groups.google.com</a></p>
<a name='Relationship between slurpy parameters'></a><h2>Relationship between slurpy parameters</h2>
<p>Austin Frank wondered about the different uses of <code>prefix:&lt;*&gt;</code> in
parameter lists and elsewhere. Stuart Cook had answers. Piers Cawley
worried about the current behaviour of <code>prefix:&lt;*&gt;</code> in parameter
lists and about how eager its flattening should be.</p>
<p><a href='http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=43B332B9.2050400@gmail.com' target='_blank'>groups.google.com</a></p>
<a name='Building the documentation that will ship with Perl 6 and Pugs'></a><h2>Building the documentation that will ship with Perl 6 and Pugs</h2>
<p>Andrew Savige outlined some off the issues that need addressing as we
move towards releasing a properly documented Pugs, and the Perl
6. After outlining issues, he called for volunteers. Nobody commented
on the list (yet), but I hope people will be taking up the challenge.</p>

<a name='$/ and $! should be env'></a><h2><code>$/</code> and <code>$!</code> should be <code>env</code></h2>
<p>Luke proposed that we change <code>$!</code> and <code>$/</code> into <code>env</code>
variables. Because almost nobody understands what an env variable is
(your summarizer had never even heard of 'em -- I think I may have to
do some serious synopsis rereading and soon) Luke explained what they
were and why they should be used in this case. The usual Sunday
Warnocking applies -- expect more detail next week.</p>

<a name='Rules should be independent of evaluation strategy'></a><h2>Rules should be independent of evaluation strategy</h2>
<p>Luke talked about an idea for implementing different parsing engines
that use Perl rules but without necessarily doing recursive descent
style parsing. Nicholas Clark pointed out a typo, but the basic thrust
of the article remains in Sunday Warnock land.</p>

<a name='Acknowledgements, apologies and everything else'></a><h1>Acknowledgements, apologies and everything else</h1>
<p>Happy new year everyone. I've just opened up a 4th annual subdirectory
in my summaries directory. I had hoped we'd have the real Perl 6 by
now, but these things take the time they need I guess. Things are
looking good for the future though. Here's hoping that Audrey and the
other pugs people keep up their phenomenal rate of development.</p>
<p>I hope that, from next week you'll be able to find Matt's summaries in
the same place as mine,
