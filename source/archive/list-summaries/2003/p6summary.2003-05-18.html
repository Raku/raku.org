<a name='The Perl 6 Summary for the week ending 20030518'></a><h1>The Perl 6 Summary for the week ending 20030518</h1>
<p>Welcome back to another Perl 6 summary, this week without any 'comic'
introductions.</p>
<p>So, without further ado we press straight on to the happenings in
perl6-internals.</p>
<a name='Makefile issues'></a><h2>Makefile issues</h2>
<p>Bruce Gray sent in a patch to tweak Parrot's Makefile to ensure that
IMCC could be built before doing either <code>make test</code> or <code>make
static</code>. The various executables in the Parrot distribution now link
against <b><i>libparrot.a</i></b> instead of just linking a bunch of .o
files. Steve Fink liked the idea, and made a few other suggestions
(building IMCC by default, having make test run the IMCC
tests...). The patch was later applied by Bruce after Steve Fink gave
him committer superpowers.</p>

<a name='Even more on stack walking'></a><h2>Even more on stack walking</h2>
<p>The discussion of garbage collection and timely destruction came up
again. Essentially, we want to have our cake and eat it too.</p>
<p>Here's some background. Consider the following piece of code:</p>
<pre>    sub iterate_over_file {
        my($filename, $code) = @_;
        open my $fh, '&lt;', $filename or die;
        &amp;$code($_) for &lt;$fh&gt;;
    }</pre>
<p>Unless I'm going mad, this should be legal code in both Perl 5 and
Perl 6. Now, consider what what happens when execution leaves the
<code>iterate_over_file</code> function. In Perl 5 the file handle in <code>$fh</code> has
its reference count decremented and, because there are no remaining
references, the file is closed and the filehandle is destroyed. In a
Perl 6 with no 'special case' garbage collection added, nothing
happens. <code>$fh</code> only gets closed when a Dead Object Detection (DOD)
run is triggered, which need not happen for a while, potentially
leading to resource leaks or locking issues or other unforseen
consequences.</p>
<p>One way around this is for classes whose objects need timely
destruction to tell Perl that there are some of its objects floating
about so that Perl can trigger a DOD run at the end of every scope
until there are no more such objects floating around. But that could
be expensive (as Luke Palmer demonstrated with a neat piece of
pathological code). Luke suggested a scheme where variables would have
a needsDOD property (or some such thing) and a DOD would be triggered
at the end of any scope that contained such a variable. Benjamin
Goldberg offered a suggestion for a hybrid reference counting/full GC
scheme.</p>
<p>Garrett Goebel pointed out that the details of how Perl 6 implements
this are really irrelevant at the moment; Dan has said there will be a
way to trigger a DOD run at any time, which means that Parrot should
support whatever scheme the Perl 6 implementers come up with.</p>

<a name='BASIC gets fancy'></a><h2>BASIC gets fancy</h2>
<p>Clinton A. Pierce announced that the compiled version of BASIC under
<b><i>languages/BASIC/compiler</i></b> now supports the QuickBASIC style
<code>COLOR</code>, <code>LOCATE</code> and <code>CLS</code> statements. These additions prompted
Leon Brocard to post a colour version of <b><i>mandel.bas</i></b> which generates
a colour representation of the Mandelbrot set.</p>

<a name='More sub/method call stuff'></a><h2>More sub/method call stuff</h2>
<p>Dan announced that now we know what the calling conventions will be,
we should look at how we should make calls to parrot functions. He
outlined a continuation passing style approach which looks like it
should have all the right magic.</p>
<p>Hmm... I just tried to write a short description of continuation
passing style and ended up duplicating most of Dan's post, but not so
well written, you're better off reading that.</p>
<p>The general response to this was positive (once people had got over
boggling at the idea of data encapsulation in an 'assembler').</p>
<p>There was also some discussion of how continuations, tied variables
and hypotheticals would interact (answer: We don't know yet, but it
looks interesting...)</p>

<a name='Indexing registers or something'></a><h2>Indexing registers or something</h2>
<p>Klaas-Jan Stol wondered about adding some way of doing register based
indirect addressing (as Dan called it), which would allow for
iterating over a set of registers in a loop (amongst other
things). Dan suggested a couple of ways of doing it, but wanted a
usage case for compiler-generated code before he went implementing
anything. Klaas-Jan suggested a Lua construct that's analogous to the
Perlish <code>($a, $b, $c) = (f(), g(), h())</code> as an example of where such
code would come in handy. Luke Palmer suggested a way of implementing
that in code that wouldn't need the indirect register addressing, and
noted that if indirect register addressing were implemented then IMCC
would probably get very confused indeed.</p>

<a name='Socket IO'></a><h2>Socket IO</h2>
<p>Andrew The has been working on getting Socket IO working in Parrot,
implementing a thin layer over the BSD socket functions and he had a
few questions about the official way to do some things. Leo
T&ouml;tsch answered some questions, and suggested that Andrew liaise
with J&uuml;rgen B&ouml;mmels, who is working on Parrot's IO layer.</p>

<a name='Using vtable macros'></a><h2>Using vtable macros</h2>
<p>Leo T&ouml;tsch offered a couple of scripts to convert a Parrot
distribution to use the new <code>VTABLE_*</code> vtable macros (it's done as a
script because some many people have their own collection of patches
in place, so a simple CVS commit doesn't catch all the vtable
accesses).</p>

<a name='Disable unused vtable entries'></a><h2>Disable unused vtable entries</h2>
<p>Leo T&ouml;tsch proposed disabling all vtable methods that are either
unused or not covered by opcodes. He reckons that this should make
changes to the class hierarchy and vtable layout much
simpler. Warnock's Dilemma currently applies.</p>

<a name='String-&gt;number problems'></a><h2>String-&gt;number problems</h2>
<p>Clint Pierce noticed that</p>
<pre>    set S1, &quot;Not really a number 2&quot;
    set N0, S1
    print N0
    end</pre>
<p>gets its string to number conversion wrong and outputs 2.00000 rather
than the expected 0.00000. Luke Palmer patched it, but Benjamin
Goldberg pointed out a few problems to do with string encodings.</p>

<a name='Fixes to Parrot::Test'></a><h2>Fixes to Parrot::Test</h2>
<p>Bruce Gray tracked down and fixed some problems with <code>make test</code>
seeing fake test failures, which turned out to arise from two
interacting bugs in Parrot::Test</p>
<p><a href='http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=rt-22225-57764.12.9895807940461@bugs6.perl.org' target='_blank'>groups.google.com</a></p>
<a name='Switched run core'></a><h2>Switched run core</h2>
<p>Leo T&ouml;tsch supplied a patch to add a switched prederefed run
core to Parrot's menu of run core options. It's slightly faster than
the plain prederefed run core, and Leo thinks it should be the default
run core when the computed got and JIT cores are unavailable. Bruce
Gray caught a problem with an embedded newline which broke a couple of
the tinderboxes. As far as I know the patch has not yet been applied
to the CVS distribution.</p>

<a name='Meanwhile in perl6-language'></a><h2>Meanwhile in perl6-language</h2>
<p>The language list was quiet this week, with a grand total of 20
messages...</p>
<a name='Contexts'></a><h2>Contexts</h2>
<p>Steve Fink had some questions about function signatures and how they
interacted with pairs. The upshot of his question was the reminder
that if you want to pass a literal pair into a function you need to
remember to put it in parentheses <code>func(1, (a =</code> 7))&gt; or it will be
interpreted as a named parameter, which will throw an error if there
isn't an appropriately named parameter or a slurpy hash param.</p>

<a name='The object sigil'></a><h2>The object sigil</h2>
<p>Luke Palmer wants a sigil to explicitly disambiguate between a
container and the thing contained (short circuiting any language level
delegation) and proposed <code>&amp;</code> as the appropriate sigil. I'm not
entirely sure that you need anything more than <code>\</code> and some carefully
deployed parentheses. I also appear to have missed something as there
seemed to be an assumption that in code like this</p>
<pre>    for 1..Inf -&gt; $x { ... }</pre>
<p>then <code>$x</code> wouldn't be a simple scalar, but an iterator, allowing you
to write <code>$x.next</code> in the body of the loop, which I have to confess
is news to me.</p>

<a name='Acknowledgements, Announcements and Apologies'></a><h1>Acknowledgements, Announcements and Apologies</h1>
<p>Thanks to everyone for everything. Particular thanks to whoever
chose both my talks for YAPC this year; I really should get around to
writing them soon. And fixing the massive bug in the module that one
of the talks is all about...</p>
