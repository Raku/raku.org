<a name='Perl6 Summary for week ending 20020707'></a><h1>Perl6 Summary for week ending 20020707</h1>
<p>Hello, good evening and welcome to the third of my attempts to
summarize the comings and goings in the world of Perl 6. When we last
saw them our heroes were getting to grips with stack performance and
having fun with the Perl 6 grammar.</p>
<p>Let's see what they got up to this week...</p>
<a name='PerlArray strange behaviour'></a><h2>PerlArray strange behaviour</h2>
<p>At the end of last week, Josef Höök (the man whose name I have to cut
and paste...) found some peculiarities when using negative indices
with PerlArray objects in Parrot. Jeff (DrForr) explained that the
problem arose from Josef using partially deprecated
assembly syntax, and that he should use the new <code>set P0[-4], 1</code> type syntax
instead; Leon Brocard (who <i>needs</i> nested datastructures) asked
when we'd see support for <code>set P0[2], P2</code>.</p>

<a name='Fun with the Perl6 Grammar'></a><h2>Fun with the Perl6 Grammar</h2>
<p>The fun never stops at Sean O'Rourke's house as he released two
versions of his Perl 6 grammar. Improvements include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a name='err and // have arrived.'></a><code>err</code> and <code>//</code> have arrived.</li>
<li><a name='Topicalization'></a>Topicalization</li>
<li><a name='$^foo variables (for subroutine creation)...'></a><code>$^foo</code> variables (for subroutine creation)...</li>
<li><a name='loop(;;) { ... }'></a><code>loop(;;) { ... }</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Sean points out that it lacks any way of distinguishing between
lvalues and rvalues, and that he's not even started to worry about
Apocalypse 5.</p>
<p>I (and I assume everyone else) was very impressed.</p>

<a name='Stack performance (and other bits...)'></a><h2>Stack performance (and other bits...)</h2>
<p>Tom Hughes patch from last week was well received and should be going
in. However, Melvin Smith pointed out that it would probably be a
good idea to apply a similar fix to register stacks. Tom and Melvin
also noted that, currently, stack frames aren't handled by the Garbage
Collector (which needs fixing for Coroutines and Continuations to work;
see later for more about continuations...)</p>
<p><a href='http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-internals@perl.org/msg10704.html' target='_blank'>archive.develooper.com</a></p>
<a name='More on multidimensional arrays'></a><h2>More on multidimensional arrays</h2>
<p>And on PMC instantiation. In the middle of the discussion about
multidimensional arrays and how to implement them, Dan commented that
&quot;It seems pretty obvious right from the start that we need some
mechanism for passing parameters when creating new PMCs, something
[...] that I've been ducking since I'm not quite sure how to do
it. Time to stop ducking, I expect.&quot;</p>
<p>If anyone has a room with a wraparound whiteboard (or a nice soft room
with a wraparound sweater), Dan can be contacted via the list.</p>
<p>In another PMC related question, Dan commented that we don't have a
list of the minimally required PMCs, and dropped a massive hint that
it'd be really good if someone would make such a list.</p>
<p><a href='http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-internals@perl.org/msg10731.html' target='_blank'>archive.develooper.com</a></p>
<a name='Reflexive threadnames...'></a><h2>Reflexive threadnames...</h2>
<p>Some bloke called Piers Cawley posted a summary of the week's activity
on the Perl 6 lists. Normally I wouldn't comment, but it actually
kicked off a thread...</p>
<a name='Ruby Iterators'></a><h2>Ruby Iterators</h2>
<p>The summary prompted Erik Steven Harrison to clarify his question
about ruby iterators and 'pass by name'. People understood it this
time. In the thread we learned a little about the strangeness in some
of Ruby's scoping rules, and Larry told us that Ruby is the reason he
&quot;decided to keep 'my' explicit.&quot;</p>
<p><a href='http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-internals@perl.org/msg10724.html' target='_blank'>archive.develooper.com</a></p>
<a name='init_method_t for coroutines and subs'></a><h2>init_method_t for coroutines and subs</h2>
<p>Josh Wilmes has been seeing a pile of compiler warnings about the init
functions for parrotsub and parrotcode not matching the <code>init_method_t</code>
type in the _vtable struct. The answer appears to be that PMC
initialization is in flux at the moment. Initially Melvin Smith added
an int argument to the function signature to allow for extra
configuration, but that was removed because, although it addressed the
issue, it didn't go far enough. Right now, Dan is trying to work out
what <i>does</i> go far enough without (like Tom Lehrer) going too far.</p>
<p><a href='http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-internals@perl.org/msg10743.html' target='_blank'>archive.develooper.com</a></p>
<a name='Stack rework'></a><h2>Stack rework</h2>
<p>Melvin Smith has modified the stack structures: stacks are no longer
circular. This simplifies stack handling, GC tracing, and allows stack
trees, which will hopefully make Copy on Write (COW) and continuations
less expensive. Which is nice.</p>
<p><a href='http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-internals@perl.org/msg10749.html' target='_blank'>archive.develooper.com</a></p>
<a name='Parrot_Context'></a><h2>Parrot_Context</h2>
<p>Continuing his march towards Coroutines and Continuations, Melvin
Smith unveiled the Parrot_Context data structure. Jerome Voillon
questioned the wisdom of a design that led to <code>memcpy</code>ing 2k for each
co-routine call. In response, Dan pointed out that patches were
welcome...</p>
<p><a href='http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-internals@perl.org/msg10756.html' target='_blank'>archive.develooper.com</a></p>
<a name='Having a COW'></a><h2>Having a COW</h2>
<p>Markus Laire wondered what 'COW' meant. Aldo Calpini told him (it
stands for Copy on Write), Nicholas Clark clarified, and Larry pointed
out that &quot;It's a real win for regexes that want to map $1, $2,
etc. onto an existing string.&quot;</p>
<p><a href='http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-internals@perl.org/msg10756.html' target='_blank'>archive.develooper.com</a></p>
<a name='Vtables and multimethod dispatch'></a><h2>Vtables and multimethod dispatch</h2>
<p>Dan returned from YAPC fired up and ready to work on the extension
mechanism, but before that &quot;we need a multimethod dispatch for vtable
calls.&quot; Which means that &quot;we're going to have to do matrices (at
least 2D matrices), class dependencies (so derived classes can
inherit from parent classes so as not to leave gaps), and method
registration at PMC load time.&quot;</p>
<p>Most of which Dan had been hoping to avoid.</p>
<p>Sean O'Rourke jokingly wondered if &quot;resolution based on distance in
number-of-args dimensional type space is right out&quot; because it would
give us bragging rights over the Java and Ruby people; Dan capped
that by saying it wasn't ruled out.</p>
<p>Mike Lambert cheered, and offered an overview of a couple of lookup
methods. He also made some points
about &quot;registering methods to be called that aren't in either PMC&quot; as
a way of allowing for pluggable (say) maths libraries, which looks
like an interesting idea from where I'm sitting.</p>
<p><a href='http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-internals@perl.org/msg10780.html' target='_blank'>archive.develooper.com</a></p>
<a name='Meanwhile over in perl6-language'></a><h2>Meanwhile over in perl6-language</h2>
<p>Mike Schwern carried on the Ruby Iterators thread with an overview of
Perl 6's different ways of creating subroutines with named arguments,
a confirmation that yes, it would be possible to write Ruby Iterator
type things in Perl 6. Luke Palmer agreed some more and Allison
Randal (a new member of the Perl 6 core team) confirmed that idea further
(with a small amount of clarification).</p>
<p>We all wondered what a Jensen Machine is.</p>

<a name='What's new continued'></a><h2>What's new continued</h2>
<p>I confess that when I contemplated summarizing this particular thread
I found myself wondering 'How?'. Maybe the strain of this sort of
thing was what led Bryan to quit. Anyhoo...</p>
<p>Raptor attempted to summarize what's new in Perl 6 compared to Perl 5,
or at least what's new in Apocalypses 1-&gt;4. Damian offered a bunch of
comments and clarifications, as did Larry, and there was a discussion
about the hyper operator, then about hypering constructors and/or the
'.'  operator; Damian scared us by making Dobermans; Uri posted some
syntactically correct Perl 6 (marked down for style though) and Ashley
Winters did cunning things with the new Perl 6 <code>for</code> loop syntax and
generally demonstrated a worryingly complete grasp of the language
(he'll be writing a scheme interpreter in Perl 6 before long...).</p>
<p>Your summarizer is left hoping that someone will incorporate the
corrections and clarifications into a revised version of the original
post which I can point you at next week...</p>
<p><a href='http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-language@perl.org/msg10178.html' target='_blank'>archive.develooper.com</a></p>
<a name='Regex syntax clarification'></a><h2>Regex syntax clarification</h2>
<p>Ralph (surname unknown) asked some questions about the syntax for code that
gets executed within a regex and wondered if it wasn't all a bit
cryptic. Allison Randal claimed, and I think I agree, that it wasn't
really cryptic, it was just a new set of mnemonics to learn. Anyway,
if you want a more explicit syntax you can 'just' doctor the current
grammar...</p>
<p><a href='http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-language@perl.org/msg10180.html' target='_blank'>archive.develooper.com</a></p>
<a name='The Jensen's Machine, generators and coroutines.'></a><h2>The Jensen's Machine, generators and coroutines.</h2>
<p>At last, Thom Boyer informed us that Jensen's <i>Device</i> is a technique
used to implement pass-by-name. He also gave us an example of why
pass-by-name is, well, weird. He also wondered about Python-like
generators. Peter Scott wondered in turn if they weren't just
coroutines in a different guise (which they are). Larry confirmed that
Parrot would definitely have Coroutines, but said that he was still
thinking about precisely how they'd fit into Perl 6, saying &quot;we want
fancy control structures to just kind of sneak into people's
consciences, just as closures did in Perl 6. [...] It'd be really nice
to find a way to explain continuations to people without inflicting
the typical tortuous explanations on people who aren't interested in
brain pretzels.&quot; He then offered a classically Larryesque explanation
of continuations &quot;... most people think they understand time travel
...&quot;, but you can read that in the original.</p>

Larry explains continuations.</p>
<a name='Speaking of continuations...'></a><h2>Speaking of continuations...</h2>
<p>Piers Cawley asked about reflective capabilities when looking at code refs,
suggesting a couple of methods <code>arity</code> and <code>prototype</code> which would
allow one to grab information about the expectations of a subroutine,
which would be very useful for people writing debuggers, refactoring
browsers and other coding tools.</p>
<p>He then spoiled everything by suggesting <code>$sub.current_continuation</code>
(later retracted because it doesn't make much sense...) and
<code>$sub.current_continuation($a_continuation)</code> (later expanded
on). This scared Dan, but he didn't see why it couldn't be done, so
Piers just got weirder and rode his &quot;I'd like to be able to do
<code>caller(...).as_continuation</code>&quot; hobby horse again. Sean O'Rourke saw
Piers's weirdness and raised, proposing
<code>$current_block.push_continuation(any(*@some_ccs))</code> as a way of doing
multithreading but I think (hope) he was joking about that, and went
on to suggest a slightly less scary, but still weird
<code>$block.as_continuation</code>. Dan got weirder still.</p>
<p>Then Piers attempted to summarize the thread so far, retracting some
things, showed how at least one of his proposals could be
implemented with a 'simple' closure and showed (and explained) a
simple example of continuation usage, along with a couple of examples
that did the same thing more simply...</p>
<p>Sean O'Rourke appeared to understand what was going on.</p>

the initial, innocuous post in this thread.</p>
<p><a href='http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-language@perl.org/msg10199.html:' target='_blank'>archive.develooper.com</a>
and then it all goes spoggly.</p>

Piers attempts to explain continuations.</p>
<a name='Perl 6, the Good Parts Version'></a><h2>Perl 6, the Good Parts Version</h2>
<p>Mike &quot;Inigo Montoya&quot; Schwern is hoping to be giving a talk with that
title to the Scandinavian Conference on Object Orientation,
so he posted his outline of what he's planning to talk
about and asked for suggestions.</p>
<p>There was then a small amount of debate about the difference between
adverbs and adjectives, and a plea from Larry that we stop calling
adjectives 'attributes' and to use 'properties' instead to avoid
terminology collision with the OO meaning of attributes.</p>
<p>Tim Bunce reckoned that the new regular expressions were a good
thing. Piers wondered if you could implement a Prolog like language
entirely within the regex engine. Erik Steven Harrison reckoned that
new regexes wouldn't really sell; people already know that Perl does
regexes better than anyone and the new parsing features would probably
not be the sort of thing to persuade a Java user.</p>

Thread root.</p>
<a name='$RS paragraph mode is not going away'></a><h2>$RS paragraph mode is not going away</h2>
<p>Trey Harris worried that the very lovely and worthwhile <code>$/ = ''</code> was
going to stop working and made an impassioned plea to keep paragraph
mode. Larry reassured him that paragraph mode would be kept, but was
becoming a per filehandle property.</p>
<p><a href='http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-language@perl.org/msg10245.html' target='_blank'>archive.develooper.com</a></p>
<a name='In Brief'></a><h2>In Brief</h2>
<p>Josh Wilmes wondered about XML. Nobody said anything.</p>
<p>It was pointed out that <a href='http://www.perlcabal.com/' target='_blank'>www.perlcabal.com</a> returns a
404. So, there's no cabal there then.</p>
<p>Bill Atkins suggested using <code>has</code>, <code>have</code> and <code>are</code> instead of
(or as well as) <code>is</code>. He also suggested that Perl 6 become more PHP
like. He got pointed at previous discussions on this very subject
(has/have/are) and was asked what was wrong with Mason/Template
Toolkit.</p>
<p><a href='http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-language@perl.org/msg10235.html' target='_blank'>archive.develooper.com</a>
Ashley Winters wondered about infinite quantifiers and greediness in
regular expressions. Larry did some thinking aloud on the subject and
I think it was decided to stick with what we have...</p>
<p>Dan pointed us all at
<a href='http://developers.slashdot.org/article.pl?aid=02/07/07/1646247.' target='_blank'>developers.slashdot.org</a>
Apparently some slashdotter wonders why Larry isn't contributing to
Python development instead of redoing Perl. Ah... Slashdot.</p>
<p><a href='http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-internals@perl.org/msg10774.html' target='_blank'>archive.develooper.com</a>
Jeff has committed &quot;a primitive first cut of a new Make system&quot;, which
looks interesting.</p>
<p>A couple of weeks ago, Dan asked people to look into specs for various
virtual machines, and the TCL machine was one of them. This week John
Porter gave us an overview of how that worked, along with a list of
ops and some explanation.</p>
<p>Brian Wheeler ticked 'Three arg chopn' off the parrot TODO list, and
Simon Glover wrote some tests for it.</p>
<p>Dan took a moment to thank Bryan Warnock for his stalwart work on the
earlier incarnation of the Perl 6 summary.</p>
<p>Erik Kidder told us he planned to add the undocumented ops to the
parrot assembly PDD and Dan asked him to hold off on that thought
while he had a look at those ops.</p>
<p>Dan says that Parrot_warn should handle a NULL interpreter by sending
the error to the standard error location. Patches welcome.</p>
<p>John Douglas pointed us all at
<a href='http://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/anton/vmgen/.' target='_blank'>www.complang.tuwien.ac.at</a></p>
<p>The PMCs formerly known as ParrotPointer, ParrotSub and
ParrotCoroutine are now known as Pointer, Sub and Coroutine.</p>
<p>Leon and others are doing interesting things with imcc. I'm not
entirely sure what imcc is. Kudos will be awarded to anyone who
furnishes me with an explanation I can use in the next summary.</p>
