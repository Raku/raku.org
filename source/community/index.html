  <h2>The <b>Raku</b> Community welcomes you</h2>
  <p>
     We are a bunch of volunteers developing the Raku Programming
     Language and Raku applications, and trying real hard to be nice
     to each other.
  </p>

  <p>Get in touch with us! Here is how:</p>

          <h4 class="trim-top">Internet Relay Chat (IRC)</h4>
          <p>
              Much discussion happens on <a href="/community/irc">#raku,
              our IRC channel</a>. This is the fastest way to get help.
          </p>

          <h4>Discord</h4>
          <p>
              If you prefer Discord for live chat, there is
              <a href="https://discord.gg/VzYpdQ6">a Discord server</a>
              available that is also bridged to the IRC.
          </p>

          <h4>Blogs</h4>
          <p>
              Another way to stay tuned is <a href="https://planet.raku.org/">reading
              posts from blogs that focus on Raku.</a>
          </p>

          <h4>Rosetta Code</h4>
          <p>
              Raku is well represented on
              <a href="/community/rosettacode">Rosetta Code</a>, where you can see
              the Raku Programming Language (and many other languages) applied to
              numerous programming tasks.
          </p>

          <h4>Stack Overflow</h4>
          <p>
              Many questions and answers marked with
              <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/raku">Raku tag</a>.

        <h4>Learn Raku and Write about your Experience</h4>
        <p>
          Use the <a href="https://raku.org/resources/">resources</a> to learn Raku and <a href="https://planet.raku.org/">write</a> about your
          experience along the way! Let us know when you do write something if you want to share it with the larger Raku community (you should!).
        </p><p>
          Some writing topics could be programs you've written, tricks you've learned, cool things about the Raku, etc.
          Because of your fresh perspective as a learner, writing educational/training material would be a great idea as well.
        </p><p>
          If anything is Less Than Awesome in your experience you can <a href="https://raku.org/community/irc">chat with us</a>, or open an issue
          on the <a href="https://github.com/perl6/user-experience">User Experience</a> repository.
        </p>
        <h4>Give Feedback on the Docs</h4>
        <p>
          Through your experience of learning and using Raku, you will have utilized the <a href="https://docs.raku.org/">docs</a>.
          You're in a good position to help us make these docs more robust. If you notice something missing, or
          something that could be better clarified, open an issue on the <a href="https://github.com/Raku/doc">Github Repo</a>.

        <h4>Help us write tests</h4>
        <p>
          Help increase test coverage of the official Raku test suite called <a href="https://github.com/Raku/roast">roast</a>.
          This is the high bar that all Raku implementations must meet. There's a lot of ground to cover, so get up to speed with the
          <a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/testing">Test module</a>, if you don't already know it, and join us!
        </p>
        <h4>Contribute to the Ecosystem</h4>
        <p>
          Once you've learned the language, you can write modules and share them in the ecosystem. We use <a href="https://github.com/ugexe/zef">zef</a> for packaging.
          See <a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/modules">this guide</a> if you have questions about how to organize modules.
          If you don't know what to write, check out the <a href="https://github.com/Raku/perl6-most-wanted/blob/master/most-wanted/modules.md">most wanted modules</a> list.
        </p>
        <h4>Hack on the Rakudo Compiler</h4>
        <p>
          <a href="https://rakudo.org/">Rakudoâ„¢</a> is the most popular Raku compiler right now. Hacking on Rakudo innards is a
          lot easier than you would think, since most of it is written in Raku. However, since it
          isn't completely self-hosting, some parts are written in <a href="https://github.com/Raku/nqp">NQP</a>.
        </p><p>
          NQP is a subset of Raku that is much smaller and simpler than Raku. Rakudo targets
          NQP. Then NQP targets various backend VMs like MoarVM, Javascript, and Java.
        </p><p>
          So you can get started right away by writing Raku, and if/when you need to access
          some very low-level functionality you can learn NQP. You can get up to speed fairly
          fast with this <a href="https://github.com/edumentab/rakudo-and-nqp-internals-course">NQP learning course</a>.
          So feel free to jump right in!
