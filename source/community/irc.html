        Much real-time discussion happens on our IRC channel, <a
        href="irc://irc.freenode.net/#perl6">#perl6 or irc.freenode.net</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        We try to be very nice to newcomers, so feel free to join us, and ask
        any Perl 6 questions you might have.

    <h3>#perl6</h3>

    <p>
        We discuss questions about Perl&nbsp;6, how to install a compiler,
        proposals for small enhancements to the specification, ideas for new
        modules - you name it.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you don't have an IRC client installed, you can use <a 
        href="http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=perl6&amp;nick=">your
        browser to connect to IRC</a>.

    <p>
        If you missed an interesting discussion on #perl6 - don't worry,
        <a href="http://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6/today">there are public logs
        available</a>. These logs also turn many Perl 6 specific abbreviations
        into links, or explain them when you hover with the mouse over them.
        A different logging facility can be found on <a
        href="http://colabti.org/irclogger/irclogger_logs/perl6">colabti.org</a>.

    <h3>Bots</h3>

    <p>A variety of IRC bots make our life easier, here's a short explanation
    of what they do - <a
    href="http://howcaniexplainthis.blogspot.com/2009/11/what-perl6-irc-bots-do.html">courtesy
    by frettled</a>.</p>

    <dl id="botlist">
        <dt>dalek</dt>
        <dd>
            Announces commits (mainly to rakudo, nqp-rx and the <a
            href="http://github.com/perl6/book/">Perl 6 book</a>
        </dd>

        <dt>hugme</dt>
        <dd>
            Hugs users, or adds them as collaborators to github
            projects.
        </dd>
        <dt>aloha</dt>
        <dd>
            Tracks karma, implements 'seen', and has a few more useful
            features.
        </dd>
        <dt>p6eval</dt>
        <dd>
            Perl 6 code evaluation bot. We use this for live testing of code
            that may be of interest to others; it chats back to the channel.
            <code>perl6: my $a;</code> will result in a test against several
            Perl 6 compilers (elf, mildew, mildew-js, pugs, rakudo, sprixel),
            <code>nqp: say('foo')</code> tests nqp-rx, <code>std: my $a</code>
            will parse the expression with STD.pm.
        </dd>
        <dt>phenny</dt>
        <dd>
            Our secretary. Sample usage:
            <pre>phenny, tell frettled to stay tuned</pre>
            phenny will then let frettled know when he becomes active on the
            channel again.
