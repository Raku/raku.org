        is a community site that presents solutions to programming tasks in
        many different languages.  It is an excellent place to see how various
        languages approach the same task, as well as to get a feel for the
        style and fluent use of each language across a variety of domains.

    <p>
        Raku is well represented on Rosetta Code (though we always
        welcome new submissions!); there are several hundred Raku
        solutions as of early 2012.  Here are a few ways to find what you're
        looking for:

        <p>
            Rosetta Code itself keeps an up-to-date alphabetical list of tasks
            already solved in Raku; you can find this in the lower section
            of the Rosetta Code

        <h3>By Category</h3>

        <p>
            Rosetta Code's category collection is weighted towards language names,
            tasks whose solutions where too long and had to be split onto multiple
            pages, and so on.  To make it easier to find the tasks you're interested
            in, here is a shorter category list, with links directly to the Raku
            solutions:

        <p>
            These tasks and solutions were nominated by members of the
            Raku community as our favorites -- perhaps because the task
            fits our collective whimsy, or because the solution struck us as
            particularly beautiful.  Here then, in no particular order, are the
            entries that -Ofun for us:

                   A 2D cellular automaton simulating fires and forest growth,
                   with 木 trees and a touch of color for the fires.

                    A simple task of finding the last Friday in each month of the
                    year, with two brief solutions: an imperative one in the style
                    of several other dynamic languages, and an impressively short
                    functional solution using <tt>classify</tt> and Whatever blocks.
