    <h2>STD and viv</h2>

    <p>Perl&nbsp;6 has a grammar that can be tweaked by the user. Hence the
    structure of the grammar must be the same in all Perl 6 compilers. This
    structure is given STD.pm6, the standard grammar. It is both specification
    and runnable code.</p>
</div>

<div id="col1">
    <h3>STD</h3>
    <p>The Perl 6 standard grammar is written in Perl 6, and specifies how a
    Perl 6 program is parsed.</p>
    <p>The source code can be found on <a
    href="http://github.com/perl6/std/">github in the perl6/std project</a>
    in the file <a
        href="https://github.com/perl6/std/blob/master/STD.pm6">STD.pm6</a>.</p>

    <p>Both STD.pm and viv are included in the <a
    href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/STD/">STD</a> package on CPAN.</p>
</div>

<div id="col2">
    <h3>viv</h3>
    <p><em>viv</em> should be read as <em>VI ➔ V</em>, where V and I are Roman
    numerals. So it's a translator from Perl 6 to Perl 5, expressly designed
    to run STD.pm6 - it compiles to Perl 5 code only features that are needed
    to run STD.pm6. However it can be used by other compilers as a base to
    produce code for other backends.</p>
