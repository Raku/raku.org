    <h2>STD and viv</h2>

    <p>Perl&nbsp;6 has a grammar that can be tweaked by the user. Hence the
    structure of the grammar must be the same in all Perl 6 compilers. This
    structure is given STD.pm6, the standard grammar. It is both specification
    and runnable code.</p>

        <p>The Perl 6 standard grammar is written in Perl 6, and specifies how a
        Perl 6 program is parsed.</p>

        <p><em>viv</em> should be read as <em>VI ➔ V</em>, where V and I are Roman
        numerals. So it's a translator from Perl 6 to Perl 5, expressly designed
        to run STD.pm6 - it compiles to Perl 5 code only features that are needed
        to run STD.pm6. However it can be used by other compilers as a base to
        produce code for other backends.</p>
