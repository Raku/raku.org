    <p>Perl&nbsp;6 is a language specification, and just like C or C++ there
    are multiple compilers for the language.</p>

        <p>NQP
        (Not Quite Perl) is <em>not</em> a Perl 6 compiler. NQP is a small subset of Perl 6
        used as a foundational tool to help write compilers (including
        <a href="https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/nom/src/main.nqp">Rakudo
        Perl&nbsp;6</a>) and libraries.

        <h4>Historical Compilers</h4>
        <dl>
          <dt><a href="http://github.com/sorear/niecza">Niecza</a></dt>
          <dd>Niecza is a compiler
          targeting the Common Language Runtime (.NET and Mono).  Its goal
          is to explore the static aspects of Perl 6 and the possibilities
          for compile-time optimization.
          </dd>

          <dt><a href="/compilers/std-viv">STD</a></dt>
          <dd>STD is Larry Wall's reference implementation of the Perl 6 grammar,
          parser generator, and some of the semantic verifier. STD is an
          abbreviation of "Standard", as in "Perl6.0.0-STD". It is written in
          Perl 6, transliterated into Perl 5 by viv.
          It is also used by
          various phases of several other compilers (mildew, perlito, elf).
          </dd>

          <dt><a href="/compilers/std-viv">viv</a></dt>
          <dd>viv ("vi" to "v", 6 to 5)
          is a compiler that uses STD as its front-end. STD itself uses viv to
          build. It is actively developed along with STD.
          </dd>

          <dt><a href="http://fglock.github.io/Perlito/">Perlito</a></dt>
          <dd>Perlito, also known as MiniPerl6,
          is a subset of Perl 6, designed as a light bootstrapping language.
          You can <a href="http://fglock.github.io/Perlito/perlito/perlito6.html">try it online</a>. It is
          actively developed <a href="http://github.com/fglock/Perlito/">here</a>.
          </dd>

          <dt><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pugs">Pugs</a></dt>
          <dd>Pugs is written in Haskell.
          Maintenance releases for successive versions of ghc are
          <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/Pugs">published</a> to Hackage.

            <a href="https://github.com/niner/Inline-Perl5">Inline::Perl5</a> executes
            Perl&nbsp;5 code in Perl&nbsp;6.  Supports Perl 5 modules including XS
            modules like <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/DBI">DBI</a>.  Allows
            passing integers, strings, arrays and hashes. Also supports calling methods
            on Perl 5 objects from Perl 6 and calling methods on Perl 6 objects from Perl 5.

            setting library</a> which defines all of the classes, routines, and terms
            available when your script starts. In Perl 5 parlance, it's roughly all the
            things you can see in perlfunc, perlop, etc. This part of Perl&nbsp;6 is
            mostly written in Perl&nbsp;6 (and NQP).
