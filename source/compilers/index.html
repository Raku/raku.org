    <h2>Perl 6 Compilers</h2>

    <p>Perl 6 is a language specification, and just like C or C++ there
    are multiple compilers for the language.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>
        <a href="http://rakudo.org/">Rakudo</a> is copyrighted by the Perl
        Foundation, was born and raised in the <a href="http://www.parrot.org/">
        Parrot virtual machine</a>, and now also runs on the Java Virtual Machine.
        It is actively developed on the
        <a href="http://github.com/rakudo/rakudo">Rakudo GitHub</a> site. <a
        href="http://rakudo.org/how-to-get-rakudo">Download or compile
        Rakudo</a>.
        </li>

        <li>
        <a href="http://github.com/sorear/niecza">Niecza</a> is a compiler
        targetting the Common Language Runtime (.NET and Mono).  Its goal
        is to explore the static aspects of Perl 6 and the possibilities
        for compile-time optimization.
        </li>

        <li>
        <a href="/compilers/std-viv">STD</a>
        is Larry Wall's reference implementation of the Perl 6 grammar,
        parser generator, and some of the semantic verifier. STD is an
        abbreviation of "Standard", as in "Perl6.0.0-STD". It is written in
        Perl 6, transliterated into Perl 5 by viv.
        It is also used by
        various phases of several other compilers (mildew, perlito, elf).
        </li>

        <li>
        <a href="/compilers/std-viv">viv</a> ("vi" to "v", 6 to 5)
        is a compiler that uses STD as its front-end. STD itself uses viv to
        build. It is actively developed along with STD.
        </li>
        <li>
        <a href="http://www.perlito.org/">Perlito</a>, also known as MiniPerl6,
        is a subset of Perl 6, designed as a light bootstrapping language.
        You can <a href="http://perlcabal.org/~fglock/perlito6.html">try it online</a>. It is
        actively developed <a href="http://github.com/fglock/Perlito/">here</a>.
        </li>

        <li>
        <a href="http://pugscode.org/">Pugs</a> is written in Haskell.
        Maintenance releases for successive versions of ghc are
        <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/Pugs">published</a> to
        Hackage. The most recent (6.2.13.20110519 as of this writing
        (2011-07-27)) was released 2011-05-19.
