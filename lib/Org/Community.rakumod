                    The Raku core development teams release the specification, compilers, and documentation they develop under the [Artistic 2.0 license](https://spdx.org/licenses/Artistic-2.0.html).

                    This is the same license established by Perl and most CPAN modules and has been adopted by almost all OS distributions.

                    The broader development community is of course not required to use this license, but there is a [large uptake](https://raku.land/stats) among the community.
