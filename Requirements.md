## basics
 - name = Raku
 - logo = camelia
 - colors = camelia (good - used sparingly - on lightdark)
 - brand = open & fun [code|community]
 - claim = works the way you think

## messages
 - expressive
 - multi-paradigm
 - Open Source

_note: each of these is distinct vs. the "competition"_
 
### plus
 - extensive & growing ecosystem (with Inline::Perl5 & Inline::Python)
 - well-behaved package manager (zef) and module directory (raku.land)
 - developer tools to cover most needs (vscode, intellij IDEs, vim, emacs)

### tools:
grammars, slangs, regex 2.0, unicode, gradual types, function composition, multi dispatch, role composition, ranges, concurrency, junctions, complex, lazy, rats

### styles: 
DSL, LLM, functional, OO, CLI, procedural, dynamic, strict, concurrent, jupyter

### proof points:
 - multi paradigm = select a code style best suited to the problem
 - control complexity = match the impedance of the solution to the problem
 - gradual types = from path from fast prototype to solid production code
 - batteries included = fewer dependencies, more consistent code

## pathways
- jump-in (primary)
- sponsor (secondary)

_note: the term "jump-in" is intended to cover both the toe-dippers and feet-wet visitors described [here](https://wayland.github.io/blog/raku/ReachingOut/Pathways-of-Entry.xml)_

## audience
 - open minded coders (typically Linux-centric)
 - coming from Rust Go Python Ruby TypeScript PHP

## positioning
 - there is a spectrum from SIMPLE to POWERFU
   - Python & Go are SIMPLE : raku is POWERFUL (aka expressive)
 - raku is heir to the UNIX language dynasty
   - C => [javascript|perl|PHP] => raku
 - with a dash of Haskell for attitude
 - a scripting language, not a systems language

## journey
 - attention = feeling constricted by Python?
 - interest = an expressive language
 - decision = vignettes
 - action = install

## feelings
- work the way you think
- more creative expression
