TODO for perl6.org:

SCALING

* please read http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl6.language/2009/09/msg32633.html
The current plan is to build the new site in source/ and includes/, which is
compiled by mowyw [1] into the directory online/. Once the new site looks
decent, the document root of perl6.org will point to what is now online/.

GENERAL

* Items in each box could be sorted by likely reader interest / current project
  activity level / something. (Example: #perl6 IRC first in "Community")


CSS/LAYOUT

* add base font size & change font specs from points to ems.

* block element widths shouldn't generally be specified in terms of font size
  (this means: change width: Xem; -> width: X% or Xpx  on divs)

* download button should NOT be moved up top; would be missing the
  (visual) point, hehe :)
